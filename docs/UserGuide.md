TAsker is a **desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage student administration, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. It still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAsker can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `TAsker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAsker.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - **`list`** : Lists all student.

   - **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com t/johndoe m/A0123456B tg/friends` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   - **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   - **`clear`** : Deletes all students.

   - **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [tg/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe tg/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tg/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tg/friend`, `tg/friend tg/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Any invalid parameter tags will be parsed as literals.<br>
  e.g. If we pass the `n/a/James` in as a parameter,
  since `a/` is an invalid parameter tag,
  it will attempt to interpret `a/James` as a `NAME`,
  rather than treating `a/` as a parameter tag and `James` as its field.

- Extra inputs to commands will be ignored. <br>
  e.g.

  - `list 1`, `1` will be ignored,

  - `exit abc`, `abc` will be ignored.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can have any number of tags (including 0). The rest of the parameters can **only** be inputted once.
</div>

Examples:

- `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com t/johndoe m/A0123456B`

### Editing a student : `edit`

Edits an existing student's information.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [t/TELEGRAM] [m/MATRIC_NUMBER] [tg/TAG]…​`

- Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- If the index is a positive integer, the format for each optional field will be checked in the above order before the index's validity is verified.
- If all inputs are valid, the existing values will be updated to the input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the student will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the student’s tags by typing `tg/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

- Only the name is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
